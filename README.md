## ðŸ§© Algorithms Covered

| Algorithm       | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **FCFS**        | First-Come, First-Served â€“ Processes are executed in order of arrival |
| **SJF**         | Shortest Job First â€“ Executes the shortest task next |
| **Priority**    | Higher-priority processes are executed first |
| **Round Robin** | Each process gets a fixed time slice in circular order |
